Documenting the steps taken to establish connection between computer and hostss

Let host be

Name: Xenon 2
User: ahmad
Host: xenon2

This is the client, client never had connection with xenon2s:

Name: Luminous
User: ahmad
Host: ?

what happens if i do ssh ahmad@xenon2s:

Without creating any key, I was able to log in by brute-forcing the password. Not good.

Ok, now I disabled Password Auth in /etc/ssh/*config, result:

ahmad@xenon2: Permission denied (publickey).

PERFECT!

Now let's create a key pair and attempt to establish connection with that.

> key id: a31365de; generated on 2025-07-13 by Luminous as part of a test"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ahmad/.ssh/id_ed25519): a31365de.key
Enter passphrase for "a31365de.key" (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in a31365de.key
Your public key has been saved in a31365de.key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:9AYIvW5abCedl6rBcAJ01H2wo6cr8feuLhcAkkUgE0s 
key id: a31365de; generated on 2025-07-13 by Luminous as part of a test
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|+Eo**o ...       |
|.=o...o....      |
|. .. ...=.       |
|   .  oo +       |
|    ooooS.o.     |
|    .=Bo=.o      |
|     B+o +       |
|    o oo+        |
|     .o*o+o      |
+----[SHA256]-----+

New keys created named a31365de.key

I believe we must now hand the key to the server via ssh-copy-id.

If server accepted passwords, one would do ssh-copy-id, but it's not possible.,
so must find another method: USB or email.


Must also add private 

STEPS summary:

1. ssh-keygen key pair
2. ssh-add private to ssh-agent
3. copy public key to server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
